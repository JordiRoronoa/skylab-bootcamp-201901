# COWORKING
App designed to improve relationship between people working in the same coworking.

## Description
The main goal of this app is to achieve people working in the same coworking to know each other better.
This will make the time they spend in the office more enjoyable as well as increase their potential and efficiency while working as they will receive more help from their office colleagues.

Once a user has registered itself, they can create a workspace (only one person per coworking should do it) or receive a link from the admin where they will login automatically in the workspace and get linked to it permanently unless the admin removes (unlink) it from the workspace.

When a user has already logged in they will be able to create services based in their knowladge or abilities and publish them in the workspace.
If another user wants to receive this service they will find it in the main menu and will be able to apply for it.

After the last user has been provided with the service, the first user will update the event with the time he has spent offering the service and will request the first user to agree.The user that has received the service will receive a notification. If the request is accepted the service will no be longer available and the time will be transferred from one user to the other.
